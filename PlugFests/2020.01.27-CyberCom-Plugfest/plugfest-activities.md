## 1. Intro

A goal of the Plug Fest is to execute use cases using OpenC2
and gather lessons learned about interoperability.
The plugfest aspect is for testing interworking
of existing OpenC2 implementations.
Let's document here what is going on, so
observers and other plugfest/hackathon groups can see what is going on
and potentially chip in to help.
Put stuff here if you could use help.

A companion page for hackathon aspects is at
[HackathonActivites](hackathon-activities.md).
Maybe someone can hack together something that will
help with you plugfest activities.

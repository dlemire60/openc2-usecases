# Physical Devices, Cloud Aplications, Digital Twins

## 1. Intro
explain sections 2,3,4

## 2. Physical Devices
Various physical devices will be supplied.
Most will be Raspberry Pi's,
but hope it to include GRiSP, Arduino, and PLC as well.
There will be many Raspberry Pi hardware configurations
depending on what peripherals are attached, e.g.:
- various LED arrays and strips
- moisture sensor
- natural gas leak detector
- ...

## 3. Cloud Devices
- webserver with overall status
- digital twins (see Section 4.)

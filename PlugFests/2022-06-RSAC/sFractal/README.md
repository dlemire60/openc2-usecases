### Ogres, Foad, for PACE
- sFractal will instantiate Open Graph Repository in Elixir for Sboms (OGRES) [repo](https://github.com/sparrell/Ogres) as a PACE system loaded with data from the [Oser](https://github.com/sparrell/Oser), SBOM/VEX/NVD examples repo, which sFractal will populate
- sFractal will instantiate Fake Orchestrator, Actuators, Decision-Makers (FOAD) [repo](https://github.com/sparrell/Foad) to test Ogres (and hopefully other PACE systems).

Ogres will be P1 (and maybe multiple instantiations so P2 also) in Figure 1.
Foad will simulate the left-hand side of the figure (ie the systems outside PACE).

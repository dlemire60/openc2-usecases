### 1.7 Automating Cyberdefense, Neal Ziring, NSA
   The last speaker of the mid-day plenary sessions
   was Neal Ziring,
   Technical Director of the Cybersecurity Directorate at NSA.  
   A long-time supporter  of security automation
   technologies and standards,
   Neal gave a short, high-level talk.  
   Attendees were encouraged by his observations
   on the steady progress of security automation
   and the current state of the community.

   Neal observed that the range of security automation
   technologies has grown in the last few years,
   and now offers sufficient breadth of functionality
   to support many different operational use cases.  
   To illustrate this, he sketched a scenario involving
   information sharing (IACD), software inventories (SBOM),
   playbooks (CACAO),
   and tailored command-and-control (OpenC2).
   He also noted that all the elements
   of the plugfest were community efforts.

   Emphasizing the need for security automation,
   Neal pointed to cyber attacker’s use of automation –
   our defenses must also take advantage of
   automation for speed and scale.  
   Interoperable automation standards are essential,
   he asserted,
   to permit defenders to collaborate
   and achieve broad effect against malicious actors.

   Neal finished up by thanking the plugfest participants
   for working together to advance the practical use
   and standardization of security automation technologies.

### 2.7 CACAO
Portions of
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi6vXKc_9ZE)
were shown in the opening plenary
to explain CACAO playbooks
and the rationale for using them.

The workshop proved the concept that
CACAO playbooks could be used for
plugfest scenarios.
A playbook was livecoded during a breakout session.

Enriching IPv4 IOC:
demonstrated one simple use case
where a CACAO Playbook
integrates an OpenC2 command
for retrieving the autonomous system number
for an IPv4 address.

### 2.18 Hereuco
Hereuco presented
[this video](https://youtu.be/q4p5-k2ZUX4)
in the opening plenary
as well as gave an in-depth tutorial
in Breakout Session 3.

HereUco LLC presented an open source OpenC2
file querying producer and consumer tool
to test multi-vendor interoperability.
Their openc2 tool is primarily focused
on helping others test interoperability
and to generate sample OpenC2 commands.
They found the event extremely rewarding as
HereUco gathered a lot of input on their OpenC2
implementation.

HereUco was gracious enough to create a cloud
instance of their tool so that other attendees
could test their https OpenC2 implementations.
A couple of companies commented that they were
able to test against the cloud OpenC2 listening
instance and were successful in inter openc2
system communications.

HereUco was represented by Efrain Ortiz. He said,
"I really enjoyed talking and coding for the other
participants,
recoding live to get multiple vendor
internetworking was a great exercise. Learned more
in a few hours than I could have accomplished in a
week.
I'm looking forward to the next one."

HereUco
published their code at

    Captures the results of "A" attempting to talk to "B". The existing sheet is OpenC2-oriented;
    feel free to add additional sheets for other kinds of interoperability results if needed.

3) [General notes:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iGMzbyavVB_W7w4szrqos5R1j6h08hNSFW7_f6iitxs)

    for example suggestions for improvement of specifications.

## 5. Feedback
“I enjoyed the interactions with other vendors in getting their systems to talk to my OpenC2 tool.
It was stressful to code and recode live, but it was a blast. I’m looking forward to the next hackathon/plugfest.”

  -- Efrain Ortiz (SBOM/Plugfest/Hackathon October 2020)

- avoid eventbrite/zoom issues by dry run ahead of time
- have all videos on youtube and make a playlist to avoid switching/display issues
- since virtual, consider several shorter sessions over several days instead of one long day
- there was issue of zoom talking over discord voice channels.
- need better way for 'birds of a feather' to find each other. Maybe have set times for certain channels to meet
- It goes without saying that the morning started rough, not much could’ve been done about that except testing a “beta” version before hand and having a backup ready to go.
-Suggestion for future events would be to have all the video hyperlinks ready to go. For example, if I were presenting that many videos I would line them up in a document and have that document on a second monitor waiting to be clicked.
- Suggestion is to have an assistant to act as the coordinator to monitor all the different channels. There was a lot going on that day,  I had to manage the audio from zoom and discord feeding into my headset and surround sound speakers so I could keep track of you asking for folks to come back. The assistant could blast a message to all the groups in discord to gather all the cats.
- Each breakout channel should have a preassigned chairperson to herd cats getting together at same time, to elicit participation, assign people to record results, etc.
